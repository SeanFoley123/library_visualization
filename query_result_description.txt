Two main distinctions: SearchQueryGet is the request data, SearchResult is the actual data
Within SearchResult:
	Statistics is the data about your search query; how many hits, how much time
	AvailableCriteria is opaque to me
	AvailableFacets has breakdowns of publishers, formats, and subjects
	Data:
		Recordformat is bleh
		Records contains all the individual results
			Records is a list of dictionaries, each of which contains:
				PLink: Link to EBSCO
				Recordinfo: Dict of very useful info; title, subject, ISBN. It's deeply nested
				Items contains similar info to RecordInfo
				ResultID: Something
				Header: Some data about whether the book is searchable, how relevant it was to the search, etc.
				Fulltextholdings: Description of each copy we have
